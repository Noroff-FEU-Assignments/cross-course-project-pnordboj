A store page for games, with an smooth mobile first design.

## Description

This store website is made to make it easy to purchase, while having a good experience doing so.
I've made this page with mobile first in mind. So that the user can purchase er sell games easily without any issues.
The website utilizes WordPress with WooCommerce plugin to dynamically display games for sale, 
so the owner does not have to hardcode or add anything to the HTML, CSS or Javascript page.
